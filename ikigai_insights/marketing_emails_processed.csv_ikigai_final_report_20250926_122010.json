      "voluntary_pursuit": "Mixed — news and club membership are likely voluntarily followed, while account-security messages are required; overall the voluntary, joy-driven pursuits are not clearly visible.",
      "everyday_joy": "Weak signal — small everyday routines (monitoring accounts, reading news, club membership) may provide structure, but direct evidence they produce joy is minimal.",

      "Deepen local community involvement: use club notices as prompts to attend one event or volunteer once a month — this can turn a transactional membership into an emotionally meaningful, everyday joy.",
      "Introduce brief, regular learning rituals: 10–20 minutes daily on a chosen topic (tech, tennis skills, current affairs reflection) to create measurable growth where none currently appears.",
      "Reduce noise to reveal true interests: unsubscribe from system/marketing messages where possible so you can better notice which communications you seek out and which activities genuinely lift you.",
