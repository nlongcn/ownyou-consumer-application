      "Treat current pattern as administrative, not ikigai — if you want to surface authentic ikigai, track emails or actions that you proactively seek out (newsletters you open for pleasure, invitations you respond to enthusiastically, project updates you act on).",
      "Convert passive notifications into an active practice: make a brief routine when a security alert arrives (review activity, update passwords if unfamiliar, note trends). That turns upkeep into a small, chosen ritual.",
      "Create a simple folder/tag system to capture emails that genuinely spark curiosity or joy. Over 30 days, note which tagged emails you eagerly open — these will reveal authentic, repeat interests.",
      "If ad/tech topics matter, deliberately subscribe to a small number of non-commercial learning sources (1–2 trustworthy blogs or short newsletters) and commit 10 minutes daily to read; this will create measurable learning frequency.",
      "Introduce one small voluntary daily activity (eg, 10-minute walk, photo a day, short journaling) connected to external interaction. Mitsuhashi’s ikigai emphasizes everyday, active, voluntary pursuits — start with something concrete and observable.",
      "Reduce marketing noise (filters, unsubscribes) so genuine personal-engagement emails stand out. More signal will improve identification of authentic ikigai patterns."
