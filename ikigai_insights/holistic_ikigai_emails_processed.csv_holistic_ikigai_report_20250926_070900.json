      "Leverage professional credibility by publishing concise case studies on linked-data integrity problems you've tracked — this supports status, networking, and learning simultaneously.",
      "Protect and ritualize everyday joy: keep weekly club/tennis time and simple 'play' sessions with tools to maintain balance between cognitive work and leisure.",
      "Translate financial values into time-saving automation: consolidate banking and subscription reviews into a quarterly ritual so financial stability supports, rather than distracts from, creative and standards work.",
      "Increase visible impact and community contribution: mentor a junior developer or host a short local meetup on verifiable credentials or AI tooling to convert individual expertise into social meaning.",
      "Set one measurable growth goal per quarter (e.g., ship a small open-source integration for a verifiable-credentials renderer or publish a tutorial for a search API) to track development and sustain motivation."
