      "emotional_meaning": "Unclear-to-moderate — communications point to intellectual interest and professional relevance; explicit signs of emotional joy (enthusiasm, personal anecdotes) are absent, so personal meaning is inferred from chosen subscriptions and event attendance.",
      "voluntary_pursuit": "Likely voluntary — subscriptions and event attendance appear chosen rather than imposed (no corporate/mandatory context in the samples).",
      "everyday_joy": "Low evidence — items are oriented toward research and professional updates rather than small daily rituals; the data suggests a sense of purpose through staying informed rather than clear everyday pleasures.",
      "growth_orientation": "Moderate — the presence of research alerts and CE-credit webcasts signals an orientation toward learning and skill maintenance, though explicit frequency of learning activity is limited in the sample."

      "Turn reading into active practice: set a weekly 30–60 minute 'research ritual' to summarize findings and note one small experiment or question to explore (paper trade, simulation, or a short blog/email draft).",
      "Increase emotional connection by reflecting briefly after events/reports: keep a one-paragraph log of what excited you and why — this converts professional interest into everyday meaning.",
      "Deepen community ties: join or form a small peer group (online or local) to discuss reports and events; active discussion increases external connection and sustained engagement.",
      "Use CE and event attendance more deliberately: pick one concrete skill or topic to master each quarter and attend related webcasts/readings, then apply learning in a small project.",
      "Introduce simple daily rituals for everyday joy: a 10–15 minute morning market/insights scan with a personal note (what surprised me today?) to build a repeatable, joy-linked habit.",
      "Broaden activity types to balance cognitive work with hands-on or creative outlets (writing short explainers, mentoring, building a small data visualization) to move from passive intake to active creation, which aligns with Mitsuhashi's emphasis on active, external engagement."
