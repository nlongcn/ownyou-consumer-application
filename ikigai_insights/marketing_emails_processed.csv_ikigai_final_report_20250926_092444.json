      "Move from consumption to participation: join a local discussion group, online forum, or civic organization related to topics you care about (e.g., migration policy or local politics) to create external connection and active engagement.",
      "Introduce learning goals to convert interest into growth: choose one subtopic (e.g., migration policy) and commit to a short course, a book, or a weekly deep-dive to build learning frequency.",
      "Track patterns over time: collect more personal engagement signals (replies, saved articles, comments, event attendance) to raise confidence in whether this area is a stable ikigai.",
      "Explore adjacent everyday activities that bring joy: where political interest overlaps with volunteering, community events, or discussion with friends — these small acts can anchor meaning in daily life."
