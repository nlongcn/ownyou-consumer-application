      "emotional_meaning": "Unclear/low evidence — there are signals of personal taste (clothing/culture) and professional engagement, but no explicit language of joy or meaning in the data.",
      "voluntary_pursuit": "Likely voluntary — subscriptions and mailing-list invitations point to chosen interests rather than imposed communications, though some items may be marketing.",
      "everyday_joy": "Sparse evidence — no clear small daily practices found; current data suggests intermittent engagement rather than daily rituals.",
      "growth_orientation": "Weakly indicated — technical event involvement implies potential skill/development interest, but explicit learning frequency is absent."

      "Lean into the technical-community ikigai: accept or attend one interoperability/test event or related meetup in the next 3 months to convert passive receipt of invitations into active participation.",
      "Turn the clothing/culture interest into a small daily practice: e.g., a weekly micro-project (style mood board, short cultural reading) to create consistent, concrete activity that brings everyday joy.",
      "Increase visible learning signals: schedule 15–30 minutes twice a week for focused learning (standards notes, blog posts, hands-on test cases) and track it to strengthen growth_orientation evidence.",
      "Convert subscriptions into interaction: reply, ask a question, or contribute to a mailing list thread to shift from passive consumption to voluntary external connection and emotional engagement.",
      "Prefer specific, small activities over abstract goals: set one concrete action per week tied to each ikigai area (attend an event, create one outfit/culture post, document one learning takeaway).",
      "Audit marketing vs authentic content: remove or reclassify newsletters that are clearly commercial so genuine personal interests stand out and can be nurtured."
