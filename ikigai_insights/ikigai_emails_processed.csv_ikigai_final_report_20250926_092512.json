      "emotional_meaning": "Unclear / minimal — a single news-related engagement does not show clear signs of personal joy or deep emotional meaning tied to the activity.",
      "voluntary_pursuit": "Likely voluntary but unconfirmed — the engagement appears chosen (personal email opened) rather than imposed, yet frequency is low so it may not be a committed pursuit.",
      "everyday_joy": "Not evident — no small daily rituals or specific activities identified that consistently bring meaning.",
      "growth_orientation": "Absent in the data — learning frequency is zero and there is no sign of deliberate skill- or knowledge-building."

      "Treat this interest as a seed: pick a narrow topic (e.g., migration policy or a local issue) and follow it actively for a month to see if it sparks regular interest.",
      "Convert passive reading into active engagement: comment on articles, discuss topics with friends, or write short reflections (1–2 paragraphs) after reading to deepen connection.",
      "Establish a small daily ritual tied to the interest (e.g., 10 minutes of curated reading + 5 minutes of notes) to turn occasional consumption into everyday joy.",
      "Create a low-effort project to test intrinsic motivation: a weekly newsletter draft, a short blog post, or joining a discussion group — projects reveal whether interest is voluntary and emotionally meaningful.",
      "Introduce measurable learning goals (articles read, people spoken to, notes written) to shift from passive awareness to growth orientation.",
      "If the goal is to discover authentic ikigai, try a short experiment: for two weeks note what activity you actually look forward to each morning. Compare those entries to your news-reading habits to see what truly energizes you."
