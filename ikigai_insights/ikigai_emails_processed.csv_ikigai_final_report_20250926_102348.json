      "Start a micro-project (e.g., balcony garden, sketch-a-day, learning a piece on an instrument) and share periodic progress via email to a friend or community list to add accountability and meaning.",
      "Add one learning thread you genuinely choose (e.g., a university extension newsletter, public-interest blog, community workshop notices) and reflect via a weekly email to yourself on what you explored.",
      "Filter transactional/security alerts into a separate folder so personal, voluntary communications stand out for future ikigai analysis.",
