      "Deepen external connection: join one online discussion group or newsletter community focused on economics/finance to move from consumption to social interaction and mutual exchange.",
      "Turn digital-account attention into a voluntary pursuit: learn a small cybersecurity skill (e.g., set up and manage a password manager, enable two-factor authentication) as an intentional project that can become a satisfying, active routine.",
      "Track and reflect: add a simple tracker (daily/weekly) for how often you actively engage with articles or security tasks — this will clarify whether these activities are becoming genuine ikigai (chosen, emotionally meaningful, and active).",
      "If you want a stronger ikigai signal, create a small public-facing activity (a short newsletter commentary, a blog post, or occasional social-media thread) so your interest in economics converts into an externally connected, voluntary, and active pursuit."
