The low volume, limited sender diversity, and absence of confirmed purchases indicate early-stage or low-engagement behavior; implement a light-touch nurture path focused on preference capture and value-led content to broaden category exposure. Tactically, test a short onboarding/interest survey, introduce a low-frequency newsletter cadence and referral prompts leveraging personal ties, and monitor engagement to incrementally adjust frequency. Confidence is low due to limited data (overall confidence ≈0.11), so treat these insights as directional and reassess as more signals accrue.",
