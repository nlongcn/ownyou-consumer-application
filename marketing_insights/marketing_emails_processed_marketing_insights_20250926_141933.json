Action: nurture with advanced but concise thought leadership, product-status alerts (e.g., OTC quotation/trading updates), comparative explainers (trusts vs ETFs), and CE-accredited webinars, while adding role-qualification prompts. Optimize for low-friction registration and preference capture to confirm topics/region, and test mid-funnel CTAs (deep-dive briefings, case studies) rather than price-led offers until stronger intent emerges.",
