No confirmed purchases or transactional signals are present, indicating passive or early awareness-stage behavior rather than active consideration. Confidence in these findings is low (overall ~11%) due to limited data volume despite moderate completeness, so conclusions should be treated as provisional. Actionably, focus on data enrichment and structure (better tagging and preference capture), deploy light-touch welcome/re-engagement flows with broad value propositions, test low-friction prompts (preference survey or first-purchase incentive), and monitor for emergent categories to refine targeting as more signals accrue.",
