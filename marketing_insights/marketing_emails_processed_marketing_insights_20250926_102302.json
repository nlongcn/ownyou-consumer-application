The absence of confirmed transactions and zero purchase frequency point to an early-funnel or passive subscriber rather than an active buyer. Action: emphasize onboarding and value-led messaging, test personal-toned outreach against light transactional prompts, and use low-friction CTAs to capture preferences and guide a first purchase. Confidence is low (overall ≈0.11) due to sparse evidence; additional interaction and transaction data would refine these insights.",
