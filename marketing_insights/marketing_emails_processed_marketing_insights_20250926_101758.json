Given the limited volume and diversity of evidence, overall confidence in behavioral inferences is very low (~10%). Action: treat as a new/unclassified lead—deploy light-touch onboarding and preference capture (welcome survey, category opt-ins) and test basic channel/offer responsiveness. Maintain broad, non-personalized messaging until more signals accrue; if “Other” persists, review tagging and category mapping to improve classification.",
