# Check my mcp settings (2025-10-30 14:01Z)

@mcp.json (1-37) check my mcp settings

---

_**Agent (model default, mode Agent)**_

Your `mcp.json` contains configuration settings for several MCP servers and related API keys. Here’s a summary and some observations:

### Configured MCP Servers & Environments

- **context7**: Uses `npx` to run the latest `@upstash/context7-mcp`.
- **taskmaster-ai**: Uses `npx` to run `task-master-ai` with various AI API keys set as environment variables for Anthropic, Perplexity, OpenAI, Google, and others.
- **mcp-obsidian**: Uses a binary at `/Users/nicholaslongcroft/.local/bin/uvx` to run the `mcp-obsidian` plugin, with specific Obsidian API/host settings.
- **Figma**: A nested `mcpServers` key (possibly a misconfiguration; see notes below) pointing to a local URL for Figma MCP.

### API Keys Present

You have non-default (real) API keys for:
- Anthropic
- Perplexity
- OpenAI
- Google

However, some entries (Mistral, OpenRouter, XAI, Azure OpenAI) are set to placeholder values (`YOUR_..._KEY_HERE`). You may need to update these if you want to use those services.

### Potential Issues/Improvements

1. **Duplicated Key Issue**
    - You have both a top-level `mcpServers` key and a nested one inside the main object:
      ```json
      {
        "mcpServers": { ... },
        ...
        "mcpServers": { ... }
      }
      ```
      Having duplicate keys in JSON means only one will be used by most parsers (usually the last). This could prevent some configurations from being recognized.

2. **Obsidian API Key/Host**
    - Your Obsidian server is pointed at `https://127.0.0.1:27124/` with a custom API key. If you’re running this service, this looks correct.

3. **API Key Security**
    - Your API keys are visible in this config. Treat this file as sensitive and do not expose it publicly.

4. **Figma MCP URL**
    - The Figma block exists only inside the second, nested `mcpServers`—this means it may not be recognized if only the first `mcpServers` is loaded.

### Summary Table

| Service        | Command/URL                                          | API Key Present?    |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| context7       | `npx @upstash/context7-mcp@latest`                  | N/A                 |
| taskmaster-ai  | `npx --package=task-master-ai task-master-ai`        | Yes (most set)      |
| mcp-obsidian   | `/Users/nicholaslongcroft/.local/bin/uvx`           | Yes                 |
| Figma          | `http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp`                         | Not shown           |

**Action Recommended:**
- Remove or merge the duplicate `mcpServers` key. Place all servers inside a single `mcpServers` object.
- Update any `"YOUR_..._KEY_HERE"` entries with real keys as needed.
- Review which services you need and possibly remove unused or experimental entries.

how do i swtich to light mode on cursor

---

_**Agent (model default, mode Agent)**_

To switch to Light Mode in Cursor (the code editor), follow these steps:

1. **Open the Command Palette**  
   Press `Cmd + Shift + P` (on Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + P` (on Windows/Linux).

2. **Search for Theme**  
   Type `theme` in the Command Palette.

3. **Select Color Theme**  
   Select `Preferences: Color Theme` from the list.

4. **Pick a Light Theme**  
   You’ll see a list of available themes. Pick one labeled as `Light` (such as "Light+", "Atom One Light", or any other installed light theme).

5. **Apply**  
   Once you select your preferred light theme, it will be applied immediately.

---

**Tip:**  
If you want to permanently use light mode, you can set your default theme in your user settings (`Cmd + ,`), search for "theme", and set it there as well.
