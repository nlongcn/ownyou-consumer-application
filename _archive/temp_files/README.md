# Temporary Files Archive

**Archived:** 2025-10-13
**Reason:** Temporary files created by external tools

## Contents

This folder contains temporary files created by external applications:

- `~$IABTL-Audience-Taxonomy-1.1-Final.xlsx` - Excel temporary file

## About Excel Temp Files

Files starting with `~$` are temporary files created by Microsoft Excel when a workbook is open. They:
- Are created automatically when you open an .xlsx file
- Should be automatically deleted when Excel closes
- Can remain if Excel crashes or doesn't close properly
- Are safe to delete at any time

## Why Archived?

These files are archived because:
1. They are temporary artifacts from tool usage
2. They should have been auto-deleted by Excel
3. They serve no purpose for the application
4. They clutter the root directory

## Safe to Delete?

**Yes, completely safe to delete.** These are orphaned temporary files that serve no purpose.

---

**Note:** If you see similar files in the future (files starting with `~$`), they can be immediately deleted.
