- OwnYou's technology stack.

## We believe the following statements are true

**For consumer AI to deliver a personalized experience it must have access to personal data.** While some basic AI functions can operate without personal information, meaningful personalization requires user data. This creates an inherent tension between utility, privacy and security.

**Three of the largest model builders - Google, Meta and OpenAI - are developing consumer devices**, ultimately to capture personal user data. Google and Meta are working on glasses and OpenAi purchased Johnny Ives company, IO, with a view to developing a new consumer form factor. Leaks suggest it will be an always-on device, listening and capturing consumer data throughout the day. Their goal is to create an implicit contract; the device provides value but it will only work if you share your personal data. The majority of consumers will gladly accept the offer but may not understand the implications.

**Sharing personal data with intelligent third parties is risky for the following reasons:**
- **Service providers are motivated to lock in their customers.** Although data portability regulations exist in some regions, they remain limited. Users may voluntarily share information, but AI interactions generate vast amounts of additional personal data—preferences, views, family details, location information. Despite this data being created through user interaction, terms of service typically grant ownership to the service provider. This valuable information enhances user experience yet cannot be easily transferred to competing services, creating significant switching costs. The consumer looses control of their personal data.
- **Service providers have a tendency, over time, to misuse information.** While some companies maintain better practices than others, the historical pattern shows personal data inevitably being monetized through advertising. Though regulations like GDPR have improved matters marginally, users rarely receive meaningful control over which advertisers access their profiles or how their data is used. There is nothing wrong with effective digital advertising, where the user is in control of how their data is being used, and being compensated appropriately. Harvesting personal data, without providing effective control or compensating user equitably, is wrong.
- **Service providers use personal data to influence what information users see.** Despite some platforms claiming to promote transparency, users remain largely unaware of how their data shapes their information environment. As AI becomes more sophisticated, this influence grows increasingly subtle and harder to detect or resist. 
- **Service providers become massive targets for hackers.** Centralized repositories of personal data create irresistible targets for cybercriminals, with breaches affecting millions of users becoming disturbingly routine.

**Users become the product.** While the ad-supported model has enabled free access to services, it fundamentally misaligns incentives. When users don't pay directly, their attention and data become the product. The user becomes the product. While digital advertising can provide value by connecting consumers to relevant products, the reality is often excessive, irrelevant, advertising driven by incomplete data, or low-quality advertisers. Platforms extract super-normal profits while innovation stagnates, protected by high switching costs and monopolistic market power. Facebook generated $91bn in operating cashflow in 2024, roughly 45% of that was from the US, with 194m monthly active users. That suggest around $210 per active American user. Put differently, operating profit was $69.7bn but that included $43bn of R&D expenses (AI and VR related). Excluding the R&D, each user generated or $260 per US user, $5,200 over 20 years. In very simplistic terms, that suggests each new Meta customer is worth $5,000. Do you think you received $5,000 worth of value from Meta over the last 20 years? You provide content to the platform and in turn you get to see other peoples content and Meta gets $260 a year for providing you with the network. 

**Web 2.0 systems and their relatively-dumb algorithms presented significant risks.** While Web 2.0 connect billions of people, attention-capture mechanisms can be particularly harmful. Algorithms engineered to maximize engagement trigger dopamine responses, subjecting users—especially vulnerable populations like children—to excessive stimulation and often inappropriate content. Though some platforms have implemented safety measures, these remain inadequate against the fundamental incentive to capture and monetise attention. What happens when these platforms become intelligent? Are you likely to be more or less influenced when the social media services you currently use become intelligent? How do you feel about sharing your personal information with intelligent systems? The outcome, what happens as we share our personal data with intelligent systems, lies any where from being at least as bad as the current dumb web2.0 algorithms to an existential event. We don't need to be on the spectrum.

**Advertisers are increasingly battling sophisticated forms of ad fraud**, including fake impressions from bots, domain spoofing that disguises low-quality sites as premium, and deceptive tactics like pixel stuffing and ad stacking. Other schemes involve click farms, fraudulent app installs, and conversions generated by emulators or device farms. Made-for-advertising (MFA) sites and connected TV (CTV) fraud—such as spoofed devices and manipulated bid requests—further drain budgets and distort campaign effectiveness. By cryptographically linking real humans, with proof-of-human credentials into every ad impression, OwnYou makes it difficult, and expensive, for fraudulent actors to spoof impressions. By providing provably authentic consumer profiles, we help advertisers target and grow their audience. With peer-to-peer tracking, we help advertisers retarget users and improve conversion rates, and monitor campaign performance more effectively. OwnYou provides advertisers with next-generation programmatic advertising tools that substantially improve returns on advertising spend while treating individuals as partners rather than cattle.

>Advertisers can verify individuals are human using verified credentials, issued by trusted institutions.

**Publishers struggle as third party cookies are deprecated.** Apple's ATT and now Google's upcoming cookie opt-out prompt impact audience targeting and campaign performance metrics. With lower quality targeting on the open web, advertisers lean towards the stronger publishers, with paywalls and logins that capture first-party data, and towards walled gardens (Meta, Google, etc). Over the last few years, the growth in advertising spending has been almost entirely captured by large publishers, often capitalising on strong first-party data and private market places.  Smaller publishers are forced to rely on lower CPM open-market pricing and  lower quality advertising revenue streams, like native advertising. As smaller publisher revenues fall, quality falls, and eventually traffic until the downward spiral leads to closure. 300 independent publishers have closed in the UK alone over the last 20 years. Advertising revenues are increasingly concentrated. A robust, free and independent press is critical to a functioning democracy. An increasingly bifurcated editorial contributes to a shrinking Overton Window which is bad for democracy as it limits the ability of diverse voices to be heard, and considered, possibly leading to less inclusive governance. We need a broad, representative, free and independent media supported by healthy advertising revenue. OwnYou provides all publishers with the opportunity to share high quality, authentic, audiences without the need for first-party data, scale or private markets.

>In web 2.0, publisher margins have been unfairly pressured by a monopolistic advertising technology stack. A strong, free and independent media is a cornerstone of any healthy democracy. OwnYou makes it possible for publishers to curate a provably human audience, with high resolution authentic consumer profiles, and with provable provenance. That translates into more revenue for publishers, and an improved reader experience 

## OwnYou value propositions

#### OwnYou solves three problems:
- *OwnYou makes it possible for consumers to leverage their personal data for rich AI experiences, without having to share that unencrypted personal data with any third party.* Personal AI, including personal financial advice, personal shopping assistance, bill management, and medical advice, benefits from rich and relevant personal data. The more you share, the better the experience. Financial records, medical records, social media and email communication - the more intimate the data, the more personal and useful the experience. OwnYou makes it possible for you to leverage your personal information without having to share it — and without worrying that some new form of intelligence might use it against you. Unlike third-party AI, individuals are incentivised to share more about themselves. The more they share, the richer the experience — without the risks typically associated with sharing personal data with third-party providers.
- In web 2.0, publisher margins have been unfairly pressured by a monopolistic advertising technology stack. A strong, free and independent media is a cornerstone of any healthy democracy. OwnYou makes it possible for publishers to curate a provably human audience, with high resolution authentic consumer profiles, and with provable provenance. That translates into more revenue for publishers, and an improved reader experience 
- Advertisers have seen their returns on advertising spend (ROAS) fall into headwinds on multiple fronts. Fraudulent impressions are increasing as bots become more intelligent. Costs have increased as technology providers promise to reduce that fraud, but deliver few material long term improvements. Well meaning, but ineffective, regulations translate into lower quality audiences. OwnYou suggests a new approach - connecting to individual directly. Paying real humans directly for the right to engage. No more probabilistic audience targeting. No more bloated advertising technology spend. 

#### The consumer value proposition and experience
Personal AI that leverages highly sensitive unstructured personal data (health and medical records, financial data, personal images, browsing history, emails etc). The user never shares that data with a third party. Instead, local services, or services operating in Trusted Execution Environments, process the data confidentially, and provides personal AI where only the user has access to the raw data, and the processed inference. As well as personalised AI, the user is able to use their personal private data to create dynamic real time high resolution consumer profiles which they share with advertisers pseudonymously, via publishers.

#### The publisher value proposition and experience
This takes us the second major stakeholder, publishers. Publishers need good data on their readers in order to sell advertising. But good reader data is difficult to acquire and complicated to manage. By integrating OwnYou's Single-Sign-On solution, the consumer is able to share their consumer profile, as well a zero-knowledge proof-of-human credential, pseudonymously, with the publisher, in exchange for access to content that would otherwise be behind a paywall. The publisher shares the pseudonymous consumer profile with their existing advertising technologypartners, using header bidding. This substantially increases the value of their inventory, generates more revenue and allows them to serve fewer adds, thereby increasing the user/reader experience.

#### The advertiser value proposition and experience
Finally, advertisers, our third major stakeholder, benefits from access to real, high resolution audiences. If the advertisers wishes to track the user/consumer/reader, they are able to request a tracking ID, in exchange for a direct payment, made to the consumer, using crypto rails.

When the advertiser serves a digital advert to the consumer, the consumers wallet is able to identify a request for tracking. If the consumer accepts then a one time tracking ID is created, capturing the advertisers campaign ID and the users psuedonymous ID. When the users signs in with the OwnYou SSO, with the same publisher or any other publisher, app or e-commerce provider, the tracking ID is shared with the consumers latest profile and their new psuedonymous ID. As long as the advertiser continues to pay the user for the right to track, the user will continue to share tracking IDs that help the advertiser track the user through their campaign marketing funnel. This extends to offline applications as well (store visits etc).

## Protocols and Applications
OwnYou is a set of open-source decentralized protocols with several reference designs.

The OwnYou Technology Stack is a comprehensive suite of open-source protocols, applications, and SDKs designed to empower users through decentralized confidential computing, including a consumer application, a decentralized publisher SSO SDK, an advertiser SDK, and a blockchain for contracts and settlement. Together, these elements create a robust framework for enhancing privacy, security, and user control in digital interactions.
#### 1. OwnYou is a consumer application
The consumer application serves as the primary interface for users to interact with the OwnYou ecosystem. It provides a user-friendly experience for managing personal data, accessing personal AI services, sharing personal consumption profiles and tracking relationships, and managing self-sovereign credentials.

The OwnYou consumer application, both mobile and desktop internet, includes:
- personalized AI services
- creation of proof-of-human credentials from third party credential providers and from personal consumer profile
- self-sovereign identity wallet, including proof-of-human verifiable credentials 
- an identity wallet that allows the user to use the publisher OwnYou Single-Sign-On Service
- storage of  high resolution consumer profile the user can share through the OwnYou single sign on process.
- a crypto wallet that creates psuedonymous IDs and links them to a one time blockchain address for payment for sharing tracking IDs

#### 2. OwnYou is a Decentralized Confidential Computing Network
The core of the OwnYou Technology Stack is its decentralized confidential computing network, which ensures that data is processed in a secure and private manner. This network allows users to maintain control over their data while enabling secure inference for personal private AI.

#### 3. OwnYou is a decentralized publisher single-sign-on SDK
The decentralized publisher Single Sign-On (SSO) SDK allows publishers to access pseudonymous personal data. This SDK enables users to log in using their OwnYou credentials, enhancing user experience while maintaining data confidentiality.
The SDK helps the publisher pipe the user pseudonymous consumer profile and tracking ID into their header bidding pipeline.

#### 4. OwnYou is an advertiser SDK
The advertiser SDK empowers advertisers to engage with users in a privacy-centric manner. By leveraging the OwnYou protocols, advertisers can deliver targeted content without compromising user data, fostering a more respectful and effective advertising environment. The SDK allows advertisers to request and pay consumers directly for tracking and completion.

#### 5. OwnYou is a Blockchain for Contracts and Settlement

The OwnYou blockchain facilitates secure contracts and settlement processes within the ecosystem. This component ensures transparency and trust in transactions, allowing users to engage in agreements with confidence, knowing their data and interests are protected.
