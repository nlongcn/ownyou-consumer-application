### What is Ikigai?

Ikigai is a Japanese term that translates to "the value of life" or "happiness in life". It is composed of two words: _iki_, meaning life, and _gai_, meaning value or worth. Essentially, it's the reason you get up in the morning. The word _gai_ originates from _kai_, meaning "shell," as shells were once considered valuable. The concept of ikigai can be traced back to the Heian period (794-1185 CE).

Unlike some Western interpretations that equate ikigai with a grand life purpose, the book clarifies that ikigai is more aligned with finding joy in the day-to-day aspects of life, or _seikatsu_, rather than one's entire lifetime, or _jinsei_. It is a multifaceted and personal concept that is understood through life experience rather than formal education.

### Core Principles of Ikigai

The author outlines several key elements that commonly characterize ikigai:

- **Focus on Daily Life**: Ikigai is found in the small, attainable joys of everyday life, rather than just in major life goals.
    
- **Connection to the External World**: It often involves interaction with others and the world outside oneself, through activities like work, hobbies, or volunteering.
    
- **Giving over Receiving**: Contributing to the lives of others brings a profound sense of fulfillment and is a common source of ikigai. This is highlighted by the longevity of Okinawan centenarians who feel a responsibility to pass on wisdom to younger generations.
    
- **Fluidity and Growth**: Ikigai is often found in things that change and progress, such as raising children, advancing in a career, or gardening. A person's ikigai can also change over time as their interests and life circumstances evolve.
    
- **Emotion over Logic**: Ikigai is a feeling from the heart, a sense of joy that is not dictated by logical reasoning.
    
- **Action-Oriented**: Ikigai is almost always linked to action, no matter how simple. It's about actively pursuing what brings you joy.
    

### Ikigai in Daily Life and Culture

Japanese culture emphasizes an appreciation for the present moment, which is a core component of ikigai. This is reflected in:

- **Language**: The Japanese language has specific words for different points in time, giving significance to each moment.
    
- **Haiku**: These short poems often focus on fleeting moments in nature, encouraging an awareness of the present.
    
- _**Hakanasa**_: This term describes the beauty found in things that are transient and short-lived, such as cherry blossoms, which are celebrated during _hanami_ season.
    

### Finding Your Ikigai

The book emphasizes that there is no single right answer to what one's ikigai is. It can be found in various aspects of life:

- **Interests and Hobbies**: For many Japanese people, hobbies are a primary source of ikigai. The book notes that curiosity is a common trait that leads to the pursuit of hobbies. Even the act of eating can be an ikigai, as seen in the Japanese dedication to food.
    
- **Work**: While a common misconception is that ikigai must be related to one's career, a 2010 survey showed that only 31% of Japanese people considered work their ikigai. However, finding ikigai in work is possible through "job crafting"—actively shaping your job to better align with your passions and strengths. This can involve reframing your perception of your work and seeing the impact you have on others.
    
- **Volunteering**: Giving back to the community without expecting anything in return can be a powerful source of ikigai.
    

### The Benefits of Ikigai

Knowing your ikigai can bring numerous benefits, including:

- A sense of happiness, purpose, and motivation.

- Greater stability and control over one's life.

- Direction and focus, which helps in making decisions and setting priorities.

>How do we prompt for Ikigai discovery?
>Is it as simple as asking questions from a large corpus of raw data?
>Should that raw data be context engineered for specific questions?

> Possible questions (taken from https://www.ramseysolutions.com/career-advice/how-to-find-your-passion#cookie-banner):
> - **Who are the people *they* most want to help?** Maybe they have a big heart for single mothers. They may love working with athletes. Or they might love serving children with their work. Think about which people group they are naturally drawn to helping.
> - **What problem or desire does this people group, or groups, have that they want to solve?** Some people are drawn to helping people address the _problems_ in their lives—anything from marital issues to leaky faucets. Others are more passionate about helping those around them fulfill their _desires_—like looking nice or saving enough money to [retire early](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/retirement/how-to-retire-early). Whichever category does the user fall into, consider the _specific_ problem or desire they are passionate about.
> - **What solutions do they get the most excited about?** There are usually several different solutions to a specific problem or desire. For example, if someone’s problem is being out of shape, they could help them solve that problem by serving as their personal trainer, creating a nutrition plan for them, or even developing a new workout app. So, once we identify the problem or desire they want to solve, which solution will get the user the most fired up.
> - **What types of work are they good at?** it is hard to be passionate about work the user is not good at. Try to identify what kind of work they love. Consider your biggest [talents](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/personal-growth/using-your-god-given-talents#:~:text=You%20can%20100%25%20work%20in,locked%20up%20inside%20of%20you.). Create a list of tasks and roles they naturally excel at. Be sure to include hard skills (professional talents/technical knowledge) _and_ [soft skills](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/career-advice/soft-skills-list) (personal traits).
> - **What types of work do they look forward to?** Think about the tasks that get them fired up when they come across your desk at work. Or if you don’t experience moments like that at the office, what tasks get your blood pumping after hours? What side projects do you devote yourself to at home even if you don’t get paid?
> - **What types of work does the user get lost in?** We’ve all had the experience of working on something and being so in the zone that it feels like time completely disappears—a mental state psychologists call flow. What types of work gets them into a state of flow? What tasks engage them so much that time disappears?
> - **What types of work does the user enjoy learning about?** Maybe they love reading books about how to get better as a public speaker. Or maybe they really enjoy real estate podcasts. If they are spending their free time digging into a topic simply because they love learning more about it and improving their skill set in that area, it most likely falls within their passion.
